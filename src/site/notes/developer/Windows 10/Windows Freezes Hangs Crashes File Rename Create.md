When creating and renaming files, folders, directories, etc. I'd sit there watching the file explorer freeze up for seconds to minutes until finally it would snap back to reality.

After a bit of forum digging, unchecking these to Privacy settings seemed to do the trick.

You can find them under the **View** tab **Options** button
