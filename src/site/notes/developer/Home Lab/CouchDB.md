## [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)
**Seamless**¬†multi-master sync, that scales from¬†**Big Data**¬†to¬†**Mobile,** with an¬†**Intuitive** HTTP/JSON API and designed for¬†**Reliability.** 

So far I've only used this for [[../Obsidian-Livesync.md\|Obsidian-Livesync]] but knowing Apache, this DB is a solid #FOSS choice

---

## start stop service
Windows ‚Üí the service is called `Apache CouchDB`


### connections
- [[../Obsidian-Livesync.md\|Obsidian-Livesync]]

### installation
1. [[developer/Home Lab/Docker\|Docker]] `compose.yml`
```yaml
services:
  couchserver:
    image: couchdb
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5984:5984"
    environment:
      - COUCHDB_USER=admin
      - COUCHDB_PASSWORD=YOURPASSWORD
    volumes:
        - ./dbdata:/opt/couchdb/data
```

### Enable CORs
`http://localhost:5984/_utils/#_config/couchdb@localhost/cors`


## use 127.0.0.1 not ~~localhost~~
sometimes `localhost` doesn't work because of your `host` file, so use `127.0.0.1` anytime your using the local install of **CouchDB** 

In Node 16,¬†`localhost`¬†===>¬†`127.0.0.1`  
In Node 18,¬†`localhost`¬†===>¬†`::1`, which is an IPv6 address

Note that in a default Mac¬†`/etc/hosts`¬†file there are two references to¬†`localhost`:

```
127.0.0.1          localhost
::1                localhost
```

So it appears that in Node 18+, it's preferring the IPv6 option.

i.e. if you change your code to

const nano = require("nano")(`http://${user}:${pass}@127.0.0.1:5984`);

then it'll work.

## check if database exists


## default user JSON
```json
{
 "id": "org.couchdb.user:john",
 "key": "org.couchdb.user:john",
 "value": {
  "rev": "1-46853c46b6d82c12e39876789ab314d8"
 },
 "doc": {
  "_id": "org.couchdb.user:john",
  "_rev": "1-46853c46b6d82c12e39876789ab314d8",
  "name": "john",
