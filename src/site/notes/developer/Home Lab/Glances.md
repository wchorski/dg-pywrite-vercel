## Webpage Blank White
The Debian apt package breaks the webpage ([github issue](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/issues/2021) tells a tale ofminified #js and open source being obfuscated)

Here is a one-liner code that 
1. that reads the current apt glances version
2. grabs the corresponding source code from github
3. copies to local library files
```bash
sudo sh -c 'wget -O - https://github.com/nicolargo/glances/archive/refs/tags/v$(glances -V|cut -zd" " -f2|tr -d v).tar.gz | tar -xz -C /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/glances/outputs/static/ --strip-components=4 --wildcards glances-*/glances/outputs/static/public/'
```
