## setup
- run the sync script manually once you point directories
- you can either fire off the sync script via a **Windows Schedule** or **Bash Script** 
- use their [RealTimeSync](https://freefilesync.org/manual.php?topic=realtimesync) version if you need something that **watches** a directory 

### connections
- iTunes
- [[developer/Home Lab/Jellyfin\|Jellyfin]]

### installation
