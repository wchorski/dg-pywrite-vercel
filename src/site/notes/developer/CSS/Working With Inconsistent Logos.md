There are a few common problems when working with not so stellar logos sent in by the client

### Problems
1. different aspect ratios
2. resizing causes stretching
3. non-transparent (white or black background)

```css
.frame img {
	width: 15%;
	aspect-ratio: 3/2;
	object-fit: contain;
	mix-blend-mode: color-burn;
}
```
