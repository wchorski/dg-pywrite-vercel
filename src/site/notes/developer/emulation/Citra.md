3DS emulator

I recommend getting a **New 3DS XL / LL** and loading Luma3ds to run native 3ds, DS, & Gameboy games.

## 3DS as SAMBA share
just like setting up a PC with [[developer/Home Lab/SAMBA\|SAMBA]], you can also wirelessly transfer data to and from PC as if the 3DS's SD card was any other mounted drive.

my 3ds did not automatically show up in my networks tab, so I just mounted the drive manually with `\\3DLIME\microSD\` and it worked

## transfer / manage save data
[link](https://citra-emu.org/wiki/dumping-save-data-from-a-3ds-console/#:~:text=Transferring Save Data 1 Open Checkpoint. ... 2,in Step 4] to the computer. More items)
important thing to note is that whatever tool used to get the save data off of the 3DS supports exporting _expanded_ save data. Save data lives in Citra’s emulated SD card directories (`user/sdmc/Nintendo 3DS/000...0/000...0/title/[game-TID-high]/[game-TID-low]/data/00000001/`).

I use [Checkpoint 3DS - GameBrew](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/Checkpoint_3DS) because it's the most simple. and also compatible with the Switch 
1. navigate **Checkpoint** 3ds rom to backup game's save data
2. on 3ds SD card - `/3ds/Checkpoint/saves/<Game Name>/<checkpoint folder>` 
3. in **Citra** open the save directory by right-clicking on a game in and clicking “Open Save Data Directory”

                └── title

                        └── 0007ae00
                            └── data
                                └── 00000001
                                    └── BigRedSave.dat
```

## inject gameboy advance games as virtual console titles
I recommend this over emulation in **Twilight** as you get native support and menu icon
