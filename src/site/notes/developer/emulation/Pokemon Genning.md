genning a legal, proper Pokémon includes knowledge of what moves a Pokémon can get and when, knowing proper EV and IV spreads (Hidden Powers are a thing), and giving them the correct abilities.

I like playing Pokémon, but I'm not a fan of grinding my Pokémon to perfection to have some chance in PvP Online

## Pokémon Ranch
The reason why I got into genning Pokémon. I was inspired to save and edit the save file of My Pokémon Ranch game (Played with [[developer/emulation/Dolphin Emu\|Dolphin Emu]]). I wanted to be able to add whatever Pokémon with whatever nickname, without having to pain stakingly catching and transferring from a Dimond or Pearl game
