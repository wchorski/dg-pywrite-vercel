Watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1po1IYonV80) talking about the **Zelda Fandom** from an unbiased opinion, but also got me thinking in a more meta sense about other fandoms

When a generation grows up with a series, a strong connection is formed. I'd argue that this creates a #parasocial relationship between creator and player.

As any long time fan, I'm sure words like 

> "I would have done this differently"
&
> "The core ideas have been lost, here's how it could have been tied back to the original"

These are ideas and decisions that the **Creator** should be having about their next instalment, not the player. Don't get me wrong, I think player feedback is very important when polishing a game but I'm sure I'm not the only one when I say that some **Zelda** fans expect so much out of this series because they had a lifetime to dream up every possible feature and design

If your stuck feeling the same way about your favorite game series, I think it's a good sign that it's time to broaden the horizons. There are plenty of *Zelda clones* out there that may scratch that itch you've been looking for
