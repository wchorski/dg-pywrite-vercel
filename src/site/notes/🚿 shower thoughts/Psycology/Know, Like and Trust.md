I like this approach as it's a genuine way to achieve organic reach wile still retaining authenticity. 

This note was sparked while watching this video[^video]. The term "SEO" is dead is a bit hyperbolic, I think a more appropriate term to coin here is "SEO is always evolving". And if creating short clips in a video blog style is what attracts customers and builds trust in one swoop, then that's the move.
