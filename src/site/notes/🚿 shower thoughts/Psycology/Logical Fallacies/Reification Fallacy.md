> occurs when someone confuses the semantics of a term with what it represents. A similar term is "**reification**", where abstractions are taken to be a real thing Alfred Korzybski referred to it as "the illusion of mistaking the map for the territory" and declared the maxim "the map is not the territory"

Example is the [Atheist professor myth - RationalWiki](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Atheist_professor_myth)

> Cold does not exist, it is only the absent of heat. As such evil is the result of what happens when man does not have God's love present in his heart. It's like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light.

> Also known asÂ [reification](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Reification "Reification"). We should first notice that using the presented logic, one could claim thatÂ [poverty](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Poverty "Poverty")Â does not exist, since it is just a lack of wealth, that scurvy does not exist, since it is just a lack ofÂ [vitamin C](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Vitamin_C "Vitamin C"), that vacuum doesn't exist, since it is just an absence of matter, or even that sorrow does not exist, since it is an absence of happiness. These statements are obviously nonsensical. 
> 
> Therefore, even though cold and darkness do not exist as fundamental physical phenomena, they do exist as human perceptions, orÂ [qualia](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Qualia "Qualia").
