Now, I will give a little disclaimer: I do NOT measure my ingredients when making this recipe, so these measurements are merely approximations. As a rule of thumb: seasonings are generously sprinkled in.

Ingredients: 
```
Equal parts Italian seasoned panko breadcrumbs, corn flakes and flour
6 lbs boneless chicken breast
5tbsp butter
Canola Oil (Or preferably a non-seed oil if possible, like avocado oil)
1 Â½ large white onions, sliced
~4 tbsp minced garlic
4 eggs
1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce 

2 tbsp Montreal chicken seasoning
Â½ tbsp Lawry's seasoning salt (more to taste)
1Â½ tsp onion powder*
1 tsp garlic powder*
*Or instead of these powders, use a garlic & herb blend (i.e. Mrs. Dash, Nature's Touch, etc. . .) 
```

Start by taking your large onions and chopping them into thin slices, setting them aside. 

Then, wash your chicken and cut your chicken breasts into thin fillets by cutting your chicken at an angle. A meat knife is highly recommended for smoother cutting, as to avoid shredding your chicken. 

In a bowl, whisk your 4 eggs together with your Worcestershire sauce.

On a large plate, combine your flour, breadcrumbs and cornflakes with the Montreal chicken seasoning, Lawry's seasoning salt, onion & garlic powder and stir together. 

Take your chicken fillets and dip them into the egg wash then coat in the breading mix. I HIGHLY recommend patting/pounding in the breading INSTEAD of doing a double coat- it makes maintaining the pan much easier. 

In a large skillet, pour enough oil in to generously coat the bottom of the pan- enough oil for a shallow fry. Heat your pan and oil over medium-high heat and then toss in 1 tbsp of butter and Â½ tbsp - 1 tbsp minced garlic as well as a handful of sliced onions. Allow to cook for 30 seconds before adding in the chicken- this ensures the flavors of both onions and garlic are present in the final product. Cook chicken until crisp and golden brown (or crispier if you like!), flip and repeat. 

Be sure to periodically scoop out any loose and burnt coating as well as onions as they start to become burnt along the edges while adding fresh onions to the batch as well as minced garlic and more butter every 3 batches or so. The actual cooking of the schnitzel is the longest- as a 6lb batch will usually take 1Â½-2 hours to cook to completion. 

We've always enjoyed serving the burnt onions on the side, since they also soak up a lot of those flavors. I also recommend keeping your plate of finished schnitzel on a warmer (or in the oven at 170Â°F). Typically, my family enjoys this dish with Heinz 57 sauce, but a rich gravy would also work. 

Best served with good friends and bad laughs. 

I hope you guys enjoy a taste of my family â™¡
