>In general, this common idiom and proverb expresses the idea that good intentions donâ€™t necessarily guarantee good results, and that good intentions matter littleâ€”if at allâ€”if they donâ€™t end in good outcomes.

> Another way of understanding this phrase is that people can often hide behind good intentions; they can commit an action that results in a bad outcome under the guise of doing good.
