### Market Order
Most basic type. "I want to buy/sell now"
Be careful with stocks with rapid price change as the time from buy to actual purchase could be a few seconds
### Limit Order
"I want to buy this stock, but I only want to pay this much"
### Stop Loss
"wait for stock to rise to threshold price"
Good for an unsure stock, waiting for stock to start trending up
### Stop Limit
Combination
"wait for stock to trend upwards then buy. with a set threshold"
