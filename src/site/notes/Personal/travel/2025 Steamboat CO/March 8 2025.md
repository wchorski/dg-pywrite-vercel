Straight of Aurora, Matt & Will blaze route 88. A playful game of I spy devolves into an argument over the make and model of Pinsky's green machine. We thought about calling to settle the score but quickly forgot and the beef disappeared. 

We worry about our water levels. Keeping hydrated in the mountains is a task in itself. We also brainstorm, filling our Camel Paks with burbon, stay tuned. 

## A rest stop in West Branch, Iowa provides *rich histroy*

> Orphaned at age nine, Herbert Hoover left **West Branch** never to live here again. In later years, he returned to his humble birthplace to celebrate his long career of public service. A memorial landscape remains to tell his story: how community, hard work, honesty, and usefulness to others opened a world of opportunity— and the presidency of the United States— to a child of simple beginnings.

The next hours was a race against the sunset. A Hyatt Inn appears above the horizon

## York, Nebraska
As we unpack into our room for the night. The first mistakes reveal themselves.

### Coatless and Shoeless
Will forgets his coat and Matt leaves his boots in Aurora. Nothing like perusing the local Walmart for their wears. 

Matt finds some *stylish* closed toe crocks. The off season leaves Will in the cold. A quick trip over to Trucking Co. Supply store nets us a "good enough" coat and Nebraskin jerky.

### Night Cap
Our lodging hostest recommends a local eatery over the local Applebee's (glad to know Nebraskins have the same restaurant sentiments)

Chances Restaurant and Lounge provides ice cold brews, breaded pork chops, and roast beef cuts to fill the starving travelers.
