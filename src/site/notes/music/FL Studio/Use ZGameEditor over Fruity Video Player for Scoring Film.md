If you've tried scoring film in [[music/FL Studio/FL Studio\|FL Studio]] then I assume you tried [Fruity Video Player (image-line.com)](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/plugins/Fruity%20Video%20Player.htm) to match up your session playlist with the piece of media. 

You've also probably noticed the few shortcomings like 

1. Plugin window closing when opening other windows
2. No video export

There are a few workarounds to #1, but #2 has no solutions.

## ZGameEditor Visualizer
You can use [ZGameEditor Visualizer (image-line.com)](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/plugins/ZGameEditor%20Visualizer.htm)without the limitations and more features.

Once the window is `detached` the video window stays active and viewable as you move through your project. Plus, you can export video at various resolutions for testing or sending to others.
