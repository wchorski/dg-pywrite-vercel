## Tidal Wave
Honestly I'm all for the *tidal wave* of AI music. This is the perfect time to connect with people 1 on 1. Go to live events or chat with people in a messenger or forum. This is the perfect excuse to meet people who create and play music on a **personal level**
## New Tool or Copy Paste?
If you're still in the "AI is just a new tool that artists/producers can utilize" let me make 2 points. 
1) AI isn't as much as a creation tool as it is a *black box generator*. Imagine if some ad on the side of a billboard had your face on it (or what looks very similar). You received no money or notice for this ad. Your face was 'generated' from an AI tool that happened to have your face in it's learning data. Now apply that same logic to a piece of music 
2) We need to demystify what is happening behind the software. Right now the better AI music generators that are *'trained on real music'* work like this. 
	- It takes the actual sound file (.mp3 etc) and stems it out using AI filtering (vocals, instruments, drums, etc) 
	- possibly adds in other stems and loops from sound libraries (ready to go drop in samples) - It cherry picks different samples and mashes them together. Now let me ask you, does generating music with AI really sound like the "hot new tool" for producers or a **copy paste machine**?
